**This syllabus represents a good-faith agreement between what I propose to cover in this course in exchange for your attendance, attention, and best possible effort, all of which are signified by your enrollment.**


### Course Objectives

1.  The objective of this course is to provide an instructive and collaborative environment in which students can learn how to make data visuals using ggplot2. 

### Prerequisite(s)

There are no prerequisites for this course. Familiarity and command of R is strongly encouraged. 

### Course Materials

All course materials will be distributed via email or in the course repository on Github: <https://github.com/stevemidway/ggSeminar>

We may draw from Hadley Wickham's book on ggplot2, although this is freely available online. 

ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Wickham, H., D. Navarro, and T.L. Pedersen. Springer, <https://ggplot2-book.org/>


### Assignments and Grades

Grades will consist of five assignments that will be based on applying lecture materials to your own code. Each assignment will be worth 20 points (for a total of 100 points available throughout the semester). Assignment details and requirements will be shared during the corresponding lecture. 

| Grade |                |               |                |
| :---- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| A     | 97 to 100: A+  | 93 to \<97: A | 90 to \<93: A- |
| B     | 87 to \<90: B+ | 83 to \<87: B | 80 to \<83: B- |
| C     | 77 to \<80: C+ | 73 to \<77: C | 70 to \<73: C- |
| D     | 67 to \<70: D+ | 63 to \<67: D | 60 to \<63: D- |
| F     | 0 to \<60: F   |               |                |

### Course Format
Delivery: Per LSU policy, this course will meet in-person with masks and distancing. No remote option will be regularly offered; however, pending instructor decision, there may be times that Zoom is used (<https://lsu.zoom.us/j/8249531601>). Any missed classes need to fall under PS22 (<https://lsu.edu/policies/ps/ps_22.pdf>) and you are encouraged to report all absences to me—preferably ahead of time.  


### Course Policies

#### General
1.	Attendance will not be taken, although you are strongly encouraged to attend every class. Some material will be presented only in class, so if you miss a lecture, please make sure you have a classmate or proxy you can trust to get the notes. Please see me for any absences due to extenuating circumstances. See PS22 for excused absences. 

2.	As a rule, late assignments will not be accepted without *a priori* conditions established between the professor and student. i.e., **Assignments not handed in on time result in a 0.**

3.	Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for absence. It is also the absentee’s responsibility to get all missing notes or materials. You are responsible for anything discussed in lecture. 

4.	Exams are closed book, closed notes.

5.	No makeup quizzes or exams will be given. The only exception falls under the category of a university-approved excused absence. See me with questions.

6.	Please rely on classmates or LSU Writing Support for help (<https://www.lsu.edu/academicaffairs/cxc/writing.php>), or see me.

7.	The university student time expectation is 1:3. This means for every hour you are in class, 3 hours of work outside of class are expected to fulfill the learning outcomes. This may vary per topic or week, but please keep this expectation in mind—I do.


### Communication
1.	I will do my best to get back to comments and questions as soon as possible, and the best way to reach me is by email. I will generally get back to you within one day and will do my best to let you know if I will be away for an extended period. I am often in my office if not teaching.

2.	Please silence all phones and mobile devices while in class.


### Disability Services

1.	Louisiana State University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. If you have a disability for which you may require accommodations, you are required to register with Disability Services (115 Johnston Hall; 225-578-5919). Students that receive accommodation letters, please meet with me to discuss the provisions of those accommodations as soon as possible.

### Academic Honesty Policy

1.	Students who violate the LSU Code of Student Conduct (<https://saa.lsu.edu/code>) will be referred to Student Advocacy and Accountability. Academic misconduct at LSU includes but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to give an unfair academic advantage to the student. The outcome will range from failing the assignment to failing the class. Suspension from LSU is the common outcome for multiple academic violations. Cheating (loosely defined as plagiarism, lying, and other similar behaviors) will absolutely not be tolerated. That being said, there are often gray areas when it comes to citations and other collaborative actions, so please ask me anything about which you are remotely curious. **I can almost promise you that any question or concern you have will be easier to deal with than the outcome of cheating.**

### Classroom Safety

1.	Although college classrooms remain one of the safest places in the US, there always exists the threat of violence in the classroom. I will always do my best to protect any student while they are in my class; however, preparedness by everyone increases the chance of a good outcome in a bad situation. To this end, there are a number of resources we can take advantage of to better prepare ourselves.

### COVID-19 Statement
We remain under pandemic conditions and expect to be in this state for the entire semester. In order to consistently provide the highest quality LSU education, all students should follow current LSU guidelines. These include the following:

1.	If you have any signs of illness, do not come to class.

2.	In order to protect all campus community members, the University requires everyone to wear facemasks/cloths on campus. Failure to do so is a violation of the code of student conduct.

3.	Wash hands with soap and water or clean with sanitizer frequently, and refrain from touching your face.

4.	If you have to cough or sneeze unexpectedly, please be mindful of others nearby and cough or sneeze into your elbow or shield yourself the best you can.

5.	If you have been exposed to others who have tested positive for COVID-19, self-quarantine consistent with current CDC guidelines. <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html>

6.	Requests for remote learning due to COVID-19 concerns should go through the Office of Disability Services (<https://lsu.edu/disability/index.php>).

I may be very strict with the required precautions while in the classroom. Please make sure you are in compliance otherwise I will ask you to leave the building immediately.


### Calendar of Material

The following topics are approximately in the order we will cover them as many are concepts that will build on previous work. We may make modifications to the topics as the course materials develop, and we will devote varying amounts of time to each topic, based on interest and capacity.
