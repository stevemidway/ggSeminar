Credit Hours: 1


**This syllabus represents a good-faith agreement between what I propose
to cover in this course in exchange for your attendance, attention, and
best possible effort, all of which are signified by your enrollment.**

### Course Description

This course is designed to give advanced undergraduates and graduate
students an overview of contemporary data analytic approaches in the
field of marine science, and broadly the natural sciences. In addition
to building comprehension and understanding of a range of statistical
models commonly used in marine science and ecological research, the
course will be bookended on the front by concepts of data management
(curation, metadata development, exploratory analyses), and conclude
with topics having to do with effective data visualization, archiving,
and other steps in the data life cycle. All topics will be taught in the
versatile and developing language of R.

### Course Objectives

1.  Understand and command the process of data analysis from
    pre-analysis to post-analysis
2.  Develop quantiative methods and knowledge of when to apply them in
    order to analyze data

### Prerequisite(s)

No required prerequisites, although a basic understanding of statistics,
data, and program R is beneficial.

### Course Materials

All course materials will be distributed via email or in the course
repository on Github: <https://github.com/stevemidway/DAR-2021>

Lecture notes and materials will not be posted in the same form as presented in class; however, the companion book for the course will have reference information for nearly all of the lectures and materials can be added upon request. Access the companion text here:  <https://bookdown.org/steve_midway/DAR/>

### Computing

We will be working in an auditorium (not a computer lab), and you
are expected to bring a laptop to class. Although there may be days we
do not use computers, it is best to anticipate using one, or to ask the
prior class period about the need. Computers should be loaded with
program `R`, ideally run through R Studio.

  - Program R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
  - R Studio: <https://www.rstudio.com/>

*Mid-term grades will include the Data Management Plan and Database
Development Assignments, representing 25% of your course grade.*

### Assignments and Grade Distribution

  - **Data Management Plan (10%)**: Each student will write their own
    Data Management Plan detailing the preparation of data before a
    project, handling of data during the project, and the long-term
    curation of the data.

  - **Database Development (15%)**: In teams of 3, each student will
    contribute at least one freely-available marine science database,
    linked using functions in R, with other datasets provided by group
    members. The objective is to create a new database from merged
    information. Code and writeup will be produced.

  - **Statistical Modeling (20%)**: Each student will complete a 10
    question assignment that will focus on modeling (in R) marine
    science data and rely on generalized linear models and other
    techniques covered in lecture. Code and writeup will be produced.

  - **Literature Review (10%)**: Each student will produce a 1-page
    literature review on the data analytical aspects of a paper in a
    marine science journal. The critique will evaluate the methods (to
    the extent they discuss data collection), the analytical techniques
    used, and the presentation (visualization) of the data and results.

  - **Infographic (15%)**: Each student will produce 1 infographic on a
    science topics of their choosing (i.e., it could be your own
    research and a topic you are unfamiliar with but would like to learn
    about).

  - **Research Paper or Website (25%)**: Each student will produce
    either a research paper or website that takes marine science data,
    analyzes it, presents (visualizes) it, and discusses the findings.
    Data may be used from existing research projects outside of class.
    Code and writeup will be produced. All full assignment description
    will be made available and may stipulate one assignment over the
    other.

  - **Participation/Activity (5%)**: Each student will be evaluated
    based on their participation in class. This is not intended to
    necessarily evaluate performance, but to encourage group discussion,
    questions, and other aspects of classroom activity.

**Each graded assignment will have its own guidelines contained in a
separate document.**

### Course Policies

#### General

  - Attendance will not be taken, although you are strongly encouraged
    to attend every class. Some material will be presented only in
    class, so if you miss a lecture, please make sure you have a
    classmate or proxy you can trust to get the notes. Please see me for
    any absences due to extenuating circumstances.

  - As a rule, late assignments will not be accepted without *a priori*
    conditions established between the professor and student. i.e.,
    **Assignments not handed in on time result in a 0.**

  - Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the
    reason for absence. It is also the absentee’s responsibility to get
    all missing notes or materials. You are responsible for anything
    discussed in lecture. I do not necessarily make everything available
    a second time, as on Moodle.

  - Exams are closed book, closed notes.

  - No makeup quizzes or exams will be given. The only exception falls
    under the category of a university-approved excused absence. See me
    with questions.

  - Some assignments will require writing. Please rely on classmates or
    LSU Writing Support for help
    (<https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/studios/studio151/writing>), or see
    me.

  - The university student time expectation is 1:3. This means for every
    hour you are in class, 3 hours of work outside of class are expected
    to fulfill the learning outcomes. This may vary per topic or week,
    but please keep this expectation in mind--I do.

### Communication

  - I will do my best to get back to comments and questions as soon as
    possible, and the best way to reach me is by email. I will generally
    get back to you within one day and will do my best to let you know
    if I will be away for an extended period. I am often in my office if
    not teaching.

  - Please silence all phones and mobile devices while in class.

### Disability Services

  - Louisiana State University is committed to providing reasonable
    accommodations for all persons with disabilities. If you have a
    disability for which you may require accommodations, you are
    required to register with Disability Services (115 Johnston Hall;
    225-578-5919). Students that receive accommodation letters, please
    meet with me to discuss the provisions of those accommodations as
    soon as possible.

### Academic Honesty Policy

  - Students who violate the LSU Code of Student Conduct
    (<https://saa.lsu.edu/code>) will be referred to Student Advocacy
    and Accountability. Academic misconduct at LSU includes but is not
    limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic
    records, and any act designed to give an unfair academic advantage
    to the student. The outcome will range from failing the assignment
    to failing the class. Suspension from LSU is the common outcome for
    multiple academic violations. Cheating (loosely defined as
    plagiarism, lying, and other similar behaviors) will absolutely not
    be tolerated. That being said, there are often gray areas when it
    comes to citations and other collaborative actions, so please ask me
    anything about which you are remotely curious. *I can almost promise
    you that any question or concern you have will be easier to deal
    with than the outcome of cheating.*

### Classroom Safety

  - Although college classrooms remain one of the safest places in the
    US, there always exists the threat of violence in the classroom. I
    will always do my best to protect any student while they are in my
    class; however, preparedness by everyone increases the chance of a
    good outcome in a bad situation. To this end, there are a number of
    resources we can take advantage of to better prepare ourselves.
